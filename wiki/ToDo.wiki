#summary To-do list.

== For 0.3 release ==

Prerequisites for 0.3 release:
  * See [http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2006-December/000387.html John Gruber's comment] about "Markdown" as a consistent format across implementations.  Consider calling the text format 'pandoc format', noting that it is a light revision and extension of markdown.  Or adding a flag to turn on extra features.  Perhaps change the names of 'markdown2pdf' and 'web2markdown' to 'pandoc2pdf' and 'web2pandoc'?  Consider adding a full-compatibility mode (how much trouble would this be, for html blocks and lists and quotes in titles?).
  * Two differences btw pandoc and standard markdown:  document them or change them.  Standard markdown allows a header with no preceding blank line.  It also allows a block quote with no preceding blank line.  I don't like this, because a `#` or `>` could easily wrap to the beginning of a line and screw things up.
  * Test all Makefile targets on various machines (including linux with GHC 6.4.2, linux with GHC 6.6, openBSD, Mac OS X, Windows/Cygwin). 
  * Test Windows binary package on a Windows machine.
  * Test Mac OSX dmg.

When ready:
  * Tag 0.3 branch
  * Check out fresh copy, create tarball, OSX dmg, Windows zip
  * Upload tarball, dmg, and zip to Google Code downloads section.
  * Create debian packages and start upload to debian
  * Create and upload website.
  * Announce release on Freshmeat, and on pandoc-announce (create!), markdown list, docutils list, haskell list, etc.
 
Proposed naming scheme:
  * `pandoc-0.3.tar.gz` - source tarball
  * `pandoc-0.3.dmg` - OSX disk image (compiled on PPC)
  * `pandoc-0.3.zip` - zip file containing Windows binary and documentation

Note:  debs will be available elsewhere, so we need not put them in Downloads.

== Improvements ==

Add a way of specifying attributes?  See [http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2005-January/000960.html this thread].   

Consider changing the default Pandoc data structure so that it is more "hierarchical":
  * Instead of section heading blocks, it would have section blocks, each with a title and a list of other elements, which might in turn be sections.
  * It wouldn't be too hard to change the readers to parse this way.  And this would allow more flexibility for the writers, especially for the proposed Docbook writer, which needs a hierarchical structure of sections. 
  * Potential problem:  some existing code assumes e.g. that note blocks are at the outer level (see RTF writer); this would have to be rewritten.
  * It would be good to have a general "tree walker" utility function that makes it easy to, say, walk through the hierarchy filtering out note blocks.

Use XHTML library for HTML writer?  Not yet - it's not standard with 6.4.2 (but is with 6.6).  When we can drop support for 6.4.2, we can use it.

Figure out whether S5 really needs the XHTML header.  If not, change to HTML for consistency.  Or, change pandoc's default header to XHTML.

Note that pandoc's HTML output fails to validate completely (w3c), either as HTML or as XHTML.
  * HTML doesn't like the `\>` at the end of `<meta>` tags.
  * But if we remove them, we'll have trouble with S5 output, which seems to need the xhtml header?
  * There's also a problem with the email obfuscation scheme. `<noscript>` isn't allowed inside `<p>` blocks.  `<script>` _is_ allowed!  This doesn't seem to be a practical problem with the browsers I've tried, but it would be nice to validate.  We could move to a different email obfuscation technique (see e.g. the nice idea at http://subversion.tigris.org/security.html), but this one allows us to have mailto links.

== New feature ideas ==

Configuration file?

Add format-independent "table of contents" macro.  Something like this:
{{{

%contents

}}}
in a block by itself.  To implement this, we might add a 'TableOfContents'
block type.  In latex output, this would come out as `\tableofcontents`,
in HTML, Markdown, and RTF, we'd have to parse the document for headers
(or sections - see below) and build a nested list with internal links.
In RST, we could just use the existing contents directive. 

New [http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/simple/sdocbook/index.html simplified docbook] writer (underway in experimental docbook-writer branch):
  * See above on hierachical data structure.  A less elegant solution would be to reorganize the Pandoc data structure into a hierarchy after parsing, but before the Docbook writer is called.

Acronyms?  Perhaps like this:
{{{
the [AAAS]

[AAAS]: acronym for "American association for the advancement of science"
}}}
yields
{{{
<acronym title="American association for the advancement of science">AAAS</acronym>
}}}
