#summary Differences between pandoc syntax and standard markdown syntax.
#labels Phase-Design

Note: using the `--strict` option in Pandoc suppresses all of these differences, except the one about `<p>` tags in lists.

= Extensions =

== Footnotes ==

See the description in README.

== Reference links ==

Pandoc allows implicit reference links in either of two styles:

{{{
1. Here's my [link]
2. Here's my [link][]

[link]: linky.com
}}}

(In newer versions of Markdown.pl, these are both supported as well.)

== Title blocks ==

See the description in README.

== Box-style block quotes ==

See the description in README.

== Inline LaTeX ==

See the description in README.

= Other differences =

== Lists ==

{{{
1.  First
2.  Second:
    -   Fee
    -   Fie
    -   Foe

3.  Third
}}}

Pandoc transforms this into a "compact list" (with no `<p>` tags
around "First", "Second", or "Third"), while markdown puts `<p>`
tags around "Second" and "Third" (but not "First"), because of
the blank space around "Third".  Pandoc follows a simple rule:
if the text is followed by a blank line, it is treated as a
paragraph.  Since "Second" is followed by a list, and not a blank
line, it isn't treated as a paragraph.  The fact that the list
is followed by a blank line is irrelevant. 

[Note: this is the only markdown test we don't pass at this point.]

Unlike standard markdown, Pandoc allows ordered list items to be
marked with single letters, instead of numbers.  So, for example,
this source yields a nested ordered list:

{{{
1.  First
2.  Second
    a.  Fee
    b.  Fie
3.  Third
}}}

Pandoc also extends standard markdown in allowing list item markers
to be terminated by ')':

{{{
1)  First
2)  Second
    A)  Fee
    B)  Fie
3)  Third
}}}

== HTML blocks ==

While Markdown 1.0 leaves HTML blocks exactly as they
are, Pandoc treats text between HTML tags as markdown.  Thus, for
example, Pandoc will turn

{{{
<table>
       <tr>
           <td>*one*</td>
           <td>[a link](http://google.com)</td>
       </tr>
</table>
}}}

into

{{{
<table>
        <tr>
                <td><em>one</em></td>
                <td><a href="http://google.com">a link</a></td>
        </tr>

</table>
}}}

whereas Markdown 1.0 will preserve it as is.

There is one exception to this rule:  text between `<script>` and
`</script>` tags is not interpreted as markdown.

This departure from standard markdown should make it easier to mix
markdown with HTML block elements.  For example, one can surround
a block of markdown text with `<div>` tags without preventing it
from being interpreted as markdown.

== Block quotes and headers ==

Pandoc requires blank lines before block quotes and headers; Markdown.pl
does not.  (Note:  John Gruber has said that this may change in future versions
of Markdown.)
